# Web-Interactive-agent-

🔍 Objective:
To create a web-based document loader using LangChain’s WebBaseLoader, allowing you to scrape and ingest content from web pages into a vector database for further processing or querying.

🧱 Main Components Used:
WebBaseLoader from LangChain:

Used to scrape content from a specific URL.

Example: loader = WebBaseLoader("https://example.com")

load() method fetches and loads the web content as a LangChain Document object.

Text Splitting:

Used RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split large chunks of content into smaller, manageable pieces (for embedding).

Parameters like chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200.

Embeddings:

Used OpenAIEmbeddings to convert text into vector form for similarity search and semantic querying.

Vector Store:

Implemented using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).

Stores vectorized chunks and allows for efficient retrieval.

Querying the Data:

Used SimilaritySearch to query the content semantically and retrieve the most relevant documents.

LLM Integration:

Integrated with ChatOpenAI to generate natural language responses based on the retrieved documents.

🧪 Example Use Case:
Load web content ➝ Split into chunks ➝ Embed into vector DB ➝ Query ➝ Generate LLM-based answer.

✅ Outcome:
Successfully created an interactive web content loader using LangChain, capable of:

Loading and preprocessing web data,

Embedding and storing in vector DB (FAISS),

Querying and retrieving semantically relevant information,

Using LLM to answer questions based on retrieved context.
