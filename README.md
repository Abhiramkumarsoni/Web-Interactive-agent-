# 🧠 Web Interactive Agent – AI-Powered Document Q&A App

An intelligent web application that lets users upload documents or input web URLs and ask questions about the content using Natural Language. Built with **Streamlit**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, **Groq LLMs**, and **LangChain**, this app turns any document into an interactive AI assistant.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Reading and extracting insights from lengthy documents or online content can be inefficient. This project provides an AI-powered interface to **chat with any document or webpage**, simplifying research and understanding.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload `.txt` files or provide a webpage URL  
- 🧠 Embedding generation using HuggingFace (`MiniLM-L6-v2`)  
- 🔍 Fast semantic search using FAISS  
- 🤖 Real-time response generation using **Groq LLaMA3** models  
- 🌐 Simple and responsive UI built with Streamlit  
- 🧩 Modular design with easy-to-extend components

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Input**: Upload a `.txt` file or enter a URL  
2. **Load**: Extract content using `WebBaseLoader` or Streamlit’s file uploader  
3. **Split**: Divide content into smaller chunks  
4. **Embed**: Generate vector embeddings using HuggingFace  
5. **Search**: Use FAISS to retrieve relevant chunks based on query  
6. **Answer**: Pass retrieved content and query to Groq LLM for an answer  
7. **Display**: Show the response in the Streamlit UI
